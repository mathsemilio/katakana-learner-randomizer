# Katakana Learner Randomizer Game
A simple, yet effective, Katakana Syllabary randomization game for Android.

## Application Objective
This app aims to help learners of the Japanese language, quickly make visual associations with the Katakana letters
and their associated Hepburn romanizations.

<i>For more info on Katakana, please refer to this page:</i>
[Wikipedia - Katakana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katakana)

### How it works?
Once the user starts the game, the app's algorithm generates a random order of the 47 most common Katakana letters. And presents 
the user with a random letter and four options of romanizations. The user simply has to select the romanization that matches 
the current letter on the screen. Once the user selects a romanization, he clicks on a button to verify his answer. If his answer is correct,
he scores a point. Else, he is alerted about his answer, and a dialog shows the correct romanization for that letter.
<p>Once the user goes though all the letters, he will be directed to a score screen, where he can share his final game score
and finish the game.</p>

**NOTE:** <i>This application shares the same code base from </i>
